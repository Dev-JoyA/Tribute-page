        <p>This is a good day, just like every other day to talk about my dad. I hope somehow, somewhere you are watching and celebrating the legacies you have left behind.</p>
        <p>You where the very first friend I had in life, I remenber wanting to do everything with you, how you tried to protect me in all the ways you could. Even in your imperfection i gained strength, you had always been my greatest cheerleader, in your words <strong><q>Joy I know you will do great things in this life </q></strong>, and i can only hope you are here to celebrate with me when it happens, as I am on a path of greatness and with this journey I am on, it feels closer than ever.</p>
        <p>You where firm and sometimes very strict but the love you had for your family could not be denied, you loved me in ways I didnt think was possible, when I am sick, you won't leave my sight, when I had an accident you cried for me. You have never left me by myself for a minute. This are moment I will cherish for as long as I live</p>
        <!--closing remark-->
